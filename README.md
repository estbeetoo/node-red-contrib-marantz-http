node-red-contrib-marantz-http
==========================
# Description

Control your Marantz AVR devices over IP, by HTTP request from Node-RED.

# What's inside?

It will include three nodes:

'marantz-http-controller' : a unique CONFIG node that holds connection configuration for marantz-http and will acts as the encapsulator for marantz-http access. As a node-red 'config' node, it cannot be added to a graph, but it acts as a singleton object that gets created in the the background when you add an 'marantz-http-out' or 'marantz-http-in' node and configure it accordingly.

* `marantz-http-out` : marantz-http output node that can send marantz commands, so it can be used with function blocks.

* `marantz-http-in`: marantz-http listener node, who emits flow messages based on activity on the marantz-http device.

### Payload contains:

* string data - REQUIRED

# Install
